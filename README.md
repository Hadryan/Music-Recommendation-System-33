Methods used to build the Recommendation System:
-Matrix Factorization
-Logistic Regression
-Decision trees
-Random Forest,
-Gradient boosting
-Ensemble: Bagging and Boosting --  to combine results of all previous methods 

Improvements to be implemented:
-using neighborhood methods 
-using deep learning
-combining more results to create a more accurate Ensemble method
